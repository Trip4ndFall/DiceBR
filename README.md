# DiceBR
Dice BR is a idea that originated from my friend who often jokingly used to leave choices to the flip of a coin, but later decided to upgrade this to a roll of a dice, forming what is now called Dice BR. Myself and my friends have really enjoyed this simple yet helpful concept for when we just can't decide what game to play, and I have decided to finally automate this by creating the official DiceBR app.
## How It Works
Dice BR is used by entering six different items into the given text boxes, this was originally created for choosing between games but it could also be used for movies, books and just about anything you can name. Each dice roll will then eliminate an option one by one, until only one option remains, where that option is deemed the winner.
## UPCOMING FEATURES
- Revives (ability for options to come back if it is rolled again after being eliminated)
- Different sized dice (D8, D10, D12 etc)
- Complete visual overhaul 
- Better animation for dice roll
## Helping with this project
Currently it is only myself and my friend working on the main repo of this app but we encourage forks to be created and request that I am credited in this forked application. If you would like to implement any features from your forked repo, please contact me via trip98jjj@gmail.com and we will consider adopting some of your additions into the main application.
